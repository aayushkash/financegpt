This project is an AI-powered Stock Recommendation System designed to provide actionable insights such as "Buy" or "Sell" recommendations for stocks. By integrating data from multiple sources, applying advanced machine learning techniques, and presenting a user-friendly interface, this system empowers users to make data-driven investment decisions using data from:
- Yahoo Finance price/history
- Alpha Vantage fundamentals
- News API headlines and simple sentiment
- Gemini (google-generativeai) for the final recommendation text

### Description
This project aggregates real-time market data and news to help users make informed decisions about individual stocks. It fetches recent price history and key metrics from Yahoo Finance, optional company fundamentals from Alpha Vantage, and relevant news headlines via NewsAPI. These inputs are composed into an LLM prompt (Gemini) to produce a concise recommendation (Buy/Sell/Hold) along with brief reasoning. A simple sentiment utility is included to score news tone. The Streamlit UI lets you enter a ticker, view key stats and recent history, and see the generated recommendation.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` at project root (or export in your shell):
```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
```

### Run the App
Run from the project root so imports resolve correctly:
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

---

### How to Use
- Open the app in your browser after launching.
- In the left sidebar, enter a stock ticker symbol (e.g., `INFY`, `TSLA`, `AAPL`).
- The app will display:
  - Recent price history and key metrics (price, P/E, volume, 52-week range)
  - A generated recommendation (Buy/Sell/Hold) and brief explanation
- Adjust the ticker as needed to analyze another stock.
- Gain confidence in decision-making by checking sentiment analysis from news
